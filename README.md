Sharing some thought and happiness with 🐱**Mimi**(DSH) and 🐶**Mars**(Aussie)

## To Do List:  

- [ ] 1. Create a new branch for all other source files for Hexo.     
- [x] 1. Make a README.md file that record all steps for making a new post.  
- [x] 1. replace 头像 and some images from the website, could be done in source folder   

## To make a new post:
1. `cd toHexoDir`
2. `hexo new post ***title***`
3. write the post; don't forget tags, categories; also save images in the correspond folder
4. `hexo clean` 🧼 --> clear buffer, make sure all updated have been saved
5. `hexo g` 🧩 (generate)  --> generate html files
6. `hexo d` 🎯 (deploy) --> deploy everything to GitHub
7. DONE! ✅ 

The logic behind for using Hexo is not uploading all resources, but generate a .html from inputs. Only upload the generated .html files to Git     

## When moving to new computer
1. install Git
1. install NodeJS and npm
1. install hexo
1. download files from github repo (2 branches)
